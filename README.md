Kinetic models provide an exciting opportunity for strain design, however, this tool is currently under utilized. We hope to turn these models into an essential piece of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle.

## Introduction
*	Bayesian Optimisation using Gaussian Processes --> In this instance it will be surrogate modelling.
*	Construction of Kernel (defines the prior over the system) first order approximations can be incorporated.
*	Feasibility of kinetic models in DBTL cycle.
## Figures
*	Error of validation datasets as model size increases
    *	Central Carbon Metabolism in E. Coli/Yeast with increasing scope
    *	Should give an indication of scaling of Gaussian Processes
*	Comparison of learning rates with different optimization techniques
    *	Optimizing enzymes directly in Kinetic Model
    *	Training phase using random enzyme concentrations
    *	Training phase using loss function centered on uncertainty


## Results
*	Tuning of Loss Function
    *	Design of Experiments
    *	Strain Design Application
